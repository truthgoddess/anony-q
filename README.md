# Anony-q

_Anony-q is a chat app developed by Kate Norton (https://github.com/truthgoddess) that is primarily focused on serving good questions to good people in a way that facilitates host question management and positive user experience_

The app was created to give groups a quick and easy way of making Q&A sessions more interactive and enjoyable, and provide opportunities for more question control for hosts, and less anxious moments for users. It also gives users the opportunity to like questions they really want to hear, and to downrank questions that are terrible. It also can help keep the energy of a room up and allow users some aspect of control over their audience experience during a Q&A.

To use the app, go to the production build's website (https://anony-q.herokuapp.com/) and click on the button to make a new room. You will enter a room as a host, and be the only person who can ever be host in that room. Give the code that is on the top right of the screen to the other users. The host can delete questions by clicking a button, and it will be removed from all users screens. Users can downrank or uprank questions to increase their position in the queue.

Right now the app has been in development since 6/25/20, and is in it's early phase of development. 

Goals of this project include:

1) A production build that is always usable in its intended environment at any state, with multiple people and groups using it at once at any point.
2) A production build that is shared frequently so that its ability to act as intended is tested in instances with many people. (If you try it out anywhere and learn of a bug or something, please report the bug.
3) Development build is intended to be ongoing regularly to improve the app.
3) Anony-q will focus on the duality of security and anonymonity. Q & As are complicated scenarios, and the intention of the security and anonymonity is to provide an easier and more dynamic experience for both hosts and users. It can, for example, help conferences avoid having to deal with mic sharing, while at the same time letting more people feel like they have a mic.
4) Always focusing on speed. The project is meant to get people all connected to a room in under a minute with no need to collect data about the users.
5) Mobile or pc...It should work on both equally. Right now it is pc friendly, and needs to be mobile optimized.
6) Stylish and colorful because why not. Q & A are better when everyone is feeling good, and there's a color for everyone. 
7) Color options, for when you want more control of that ^
