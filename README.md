# Anony-q

_Anony-q is a chat app developed by Kate Norton that is that is primarily focused on serving good questions to good people_

The app was created to give groups a quick and easy way of making Q&A sessions more interactive and enjoyable, and provide opportunities for more question control for hosts, and less anxious moments for users. It also gives users the opportunity to like questions they really want to hear, and to downrank questions that are terrible.

You can see the current production build at https://anony-q.herokuapp.com/.
